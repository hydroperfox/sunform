# Sunform

Sunform is a multi-media framework that supports ActionScript 3 as the main scripting language.

The Sunform SDK contains a MXML compiler that compiles ActionScript 3 and MXML. MXML files describe GUI components tied to an ActionScript 3 package.

The Sunform SDK contains a flexible package manager which the MXML compiler is oriented to.

The Sunform API supports bitmaps with alpha channel, shapes, effects, transforms, and more, in a display list tree.

The Sunform Builder app enables creation of multi-media applications through an incorporated code editor and provides several interfaces such as for debugging and publishing an app.
